# Web_Scraping_to_IGN
Hi, this a repo where I scrape data from the website IGN. I hope you enjoy It :)

Hi, **In order for this to work well, please, just copy the code inside the file that ends with *.py*. Finally, make sure you have installed the libraries required in this file.** And, that's all. Thank u so much! :)
